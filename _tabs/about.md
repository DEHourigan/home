# About Me

My name is **David Hourigan** and I'm a postdoctoral researcher with a passion for understanding the intricate world of microbes. 

## Research Focus

My research centers on two fascinating areas:

### 🦠 Bacteriocins
I study bacteriocins—antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria that can selectively eliminate competing microorganisms. These natural weapons hold promising potential for:
- Novel therapeutic applications
- Food preservation
- Microbiome modulation

### 🧬 Horizontal Gene Transfer
I investigate how genetic material moves between microorganisms, shaping microbial evolution and adaptation. This process plays a crucial role in:
- Antibiotic resistance spread
- Microbial community dynamics
- Bacterial evolution

### 🔬 The Microbiome
My work explores the complex ecosystems of microorganisms that inhabit our bodies and environment, examining:
- Host-microbe interactions
- Community structure and function
- Microbiome impacts on health and disease

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in discussing research collaborations, scientific ideas, or questions about the microbiome.
